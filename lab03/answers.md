# Lab 3 Answers

## Part 1: Git

### 1.1. List the contents of the lab03-exercises repo immediately after initialization
```
# paste code here
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 Sep  5 10:58 .
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 Sep  5 10:36 ..
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 Sep  5 10:58 .git
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root   27 Sep  5 10:40 README.md

```

### 1.2. Paste the output of your `git status` command
```
# paste code here
git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

```

### 1.3. Paste the output of the state of your repository after committing your README.md file
```
# paste code here
git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

### 1.4. Copy your `git log` output
```
# paste code here
git log 
commit fc6356579ed42b06e5c8d2b6b626773ce8896722 (HEAD -> main)
Author: root <root@ChristiansCPU>
Date:   Thu Sep 5 11:31:53 2024 -0400

    add README.md to the repository

```

### 1.5. Copy your `git diff` output
```
# paste code here
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 9a8d849..cff67cd 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md

### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

* git init - Initializes a git repository in the current directory. 
* git status - says current branch, and staged files, as well as committed files. 
* git add - adds files to the staging area for commiting 
* git commit - records staged changes to files that were added to the staging area. 
* git log - Lists your history of commits. 
* git diff - Says what is different with each commit vs its original. 


### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)
Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)
Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).


## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem
Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.


### 3.2. Link to Repo
Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
# paste your new repo link here...
https://github.com/Csluder2/lab03-exercises
```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? 
Describe each of them in your own words.
Create a merge commit: 
Preserves full history with a single commit, makes it more complicated due to keeping everything. 
Squash and merge:
Reduces number of commits, but loses commit history within the pull request. History is cleaner because of this. 
Rebase and merge: Brings commits from pull requests onto base branch, by a fast forward merge. There can be some conflicts from this method
